		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Tintin was created by Georges Remi, a Belgian cartoonist who published his work under the name Hergé. He created the character while working at
		Le Vingtième Siècle (The Twentieth Century), a Belgian newspaper. Tintin's first adventures were the Soviet Union and then the Congo to spread the
		newspaper's political agenda to children who would read the comic, but Hergé was later given more freedom to choose where he sent Tintin and the
		narrative he portrayed. However, Hergé was forced to de-politicise the comics during the German occupation of Belgium during World War Two and Tintin 
		shifted from being a reporter to being an explorer. After the war, Hergé created Le journal de Tintin (Tintin magazine), where he continued to publish
		adventures with the help of a team until his death in 1983. Find out more about Hergé <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herg%C3%A9>here</a>.</p>
