		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Tintin was created by Georges Remi, a Belgian cartoonist who published his work under the name Hergé. He created the character while working at
		Le Vingtième Siècle (The Twentieth Century), a Belgian newspaper. Tintin's first adventures were the Soviet Union and then the Congo to spread the
		newspaper's political agenda to children who would read the comic, but Hergé was later given more freedom to choose where he sent Tintin and the
		narrative he portrayed. However, Hergé was forced to de-politicise the comics during the German occupation of Belgium during World War Two and Tintin 
		shifted from being a reporter to being an explorer. After the war, Hergé created Le journal de Tintin (Tintin magazine), where he continued to publish
		adventures with the help of a team until his death in 1983. Find out more about Hergé <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herg%C3%A9>here</a>.</p>
  
  
		<h2>Characters</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Tintin</b> is the main character of the comics. The stories follow him and his dog <b>Snowy</b> doing research for his reporting and 
			later exploration work. This often gets him into dangerous situations, but he is always able to get out unharmed and thwart whatever nefarious
			plot the bad guys have. He is somewhat boyish but doesn't have much personality beyond that.</li> <img src="images/tintin.jpg" alt="Tintin and Snowy" height="200">
			<li><b>Captain Haddock</b> is a ship captain. Over time, he goes from being an alcholic wreck to the heroic best friend of Tintin. His dry
		humour and realism counterweights Tintin's boyishly optimistic nature.</li> <img src="images/haddock.jpg" alt="Captain Haddock" height="200">
			<li><b>Professor Calculus</b> is a physicist known for his hearing problems and absent-mindedness.</li> <img src="images/professor.jpg" alt="Professor Calculus" height="200">
		</ul>
  
		<h2>Plot</h2>
		<p>Generally, Tintin sets out on a journey with Snowy, and in the later adventures with friends like Captain Haddock or Professor Calculus. Along the
		way, he stumbles upon an evil plot and puts a stop to it.</p>
