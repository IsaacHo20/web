	<h1>Text Adventure</h1>
	<p>This is a short text adventure played using the Thonny shell. The controls are simple, with only a few numbered options for the player to choose from
	and no ability to input customized actions. It has some adventuring and some encounters with enemies, which can be handled in multiple ways. This
	is a screenshot of the game being played.</p> <img src="images/textadventure.png" alt="The text adventure" height="200">
