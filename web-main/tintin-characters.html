		<h2>Characters</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Tintin</b> is the main character of the comics. The stories follow him and his dog <b>Snowy</b> doing research for his reporting and 
			later exploration work. This often gets him into dangerous situations, but he is always able to get out unharmed and thwart whatever nefarious
			plot the bad guys have. He is somewhat boyish but doesn't have much personality beyond that.</li> <img src="images/tintin.jpg" alt="Tintin and Snowy" height="200">
			<li><b>Captain Haddock</b> is a ship captain. Over time, he goes from being an alcholic wreck to the heroic best friend of Tintin. His dry
			humour and realism counterweights Tintin's boyishly optimistic nature.</li> <img src="images/haddock.jpg" alt="Captain Haddock" height="200">
